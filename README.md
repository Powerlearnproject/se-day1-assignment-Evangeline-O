#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the structured process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software.
Importance in Technology Industry:
Quality – Ensures reliable and efficient software.
Efficiency – Streamlines development, saving time and resources.
Innovation – Drives advancements in AI, cloud computing, etc.
Business Growth – Powers operations and customer interactions.
Security – Protects against cyber threats.
Scalability – Supports growing user demands.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1960s – Establishment of Software Engineering: Recognized as a discipline to address the "software crisis," focusing on structured development processes.

1970s – Rise of Structured Programming: Introduced clear coding structures (e.g., loops, conditionals) to improve readability and maintainability.

2000s – Agile Methodologies: Emphasized iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, revolutionizing software project management.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies

Waterfall follows a sequential, step-by-step process with distinct phases (requirements, design, implementation), making it structured but inflexible to changes. Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and incremental, promoting flexibility, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. Waterfall relies on detailed upfront planning with minimal customer involvement, while Agile encourages continuous feedback and teamwork.

Examples:
Waterfall is best for projects with well-defined requirements, such as banking systems or government software. Agile is ideal for dynamic projects like mobile app development or startup software, where user needs may evolve.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Writes code, develops features, and implements software solutions based on requirements.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Designs and executes test plans to ensure software meets quality standards and functions correctly.
Project Manager: Oversees planning, execution, and delivery, ensuring the project stays on track and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code, improving developer efficiency. Examples: Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS): Track code changes, facilitate collaboration, and prevent conflicts in team projects. Examples: Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Leads to scope creep and delays.
Solution: Use agile methodologies, maintain clear communication with stakeholders, and document changes effectively.

Tight Deadlines: Can result in rushed development and poor quality.
Solution: Prioritize tasks, set realistic timelines, and implement continuous integration/testing.

Technical Debt: Shortcuts or poor code can hinder future development.
Solution: Refactor code regularly, follow best coding practices, and allocate time for maintenance.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual components (e.g., login function).
Integration Testing – Checks if modules work together (e.g., login & database).
System Testing – Verifies full system functionality (e.g., entire website).
Acceptance Testing – Ensures software meets user needs before release.
Importance
- Detects bugs early
- Ensures reliability & performance
- Enhances user experience 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to optimize AI model responses. It involves structuring queries effectively to achieve accurate, relevant, and useful outputs.

Importance
-Improves AI Accuracy – Well-crafted prompts yield precise responses.
-Enhances Efficiency – Saves time by reducing trial-and-error interactions.
-Optimizes AI Use Cases – Tailors AI for tasks like coding, writing, and problem-solving. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain how artificial intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry, focusing on diagnostics and patient care."

Why It’s More Effective:
- Specific – Targets AI’s impact on healthcare rather than general technology.
- Concise – Clearly states the focus (diagnostics and patient care).
- Actionable – Guides the AI to provide relevant, structured insights.
